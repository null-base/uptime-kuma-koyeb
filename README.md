## About Koyeb and the Uptime Kuma example application

Koyeb is a developer-friendly serverless platform to deploy apps globally. No-ops, servers, or infrastructure management.

This repository contains is designed to show how Uptime Kuma can be deployed to Koyeb.  The image this repository builds bundles [Uptime Kuma](https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma), a service monitoring tool, with  [Litestream](https://litestream.io/), a tool for replicating SQLite databases to object storage buckets continuously.

You can follow the [associated tutorial](https://www.koyeb.com/tutorials/monitor-your-websites-and-apps-using-uptime-kuma) to learn more about the two components work and how to configure them effectively.

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to deploy and run the Uptime Kuma to your Koyeb account.

### Requirements

To use this repository, you need:

* A Koyeb account: to build the Docker image and run the Dockerized applications.  If you don't already have an account, you can [sign-up for free](https://app.koyeb.com/auth/signup).
* A [Backblaze account](https://secure.backblaze.com/user_signin.htm): Used to store Uptime Kuma's SQLite database files.  From your Backblaze account, you need to [create a bucket](https://www.backblaze.com/docs/cloud-storage-developer-quick-start-guide#create-a-bucket) and an [application key](https://www.backblaze.com/docs/cloud-storage-developer-quick-start-guide#create-an-application-key).
* (Optional) a [Mailgun account](https://www.mailgun.com/): to send notification emails when monitoring detects a problem with a service.  From your Mailgun account, you need to configure an [authorized recipient email address](https://help.mailgun.com/hc/en-us/articles/217531258-Authorized-Recipients).

### Deploy using the Koyeb button

The fastest way to deploy Uptime Kuma is to click the **Deploy to Koyeb** button below.

[![Deploy to Koyeb](https://www.koyeb.com/static/images/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.koyeb.com/deploy?name=uptime-kuma-koyeb&type=git&repository=null-base/uptime-kuma-koyeb&branch=main&builder=dockerfile&env[UPTIME_KUMA_PORT]=8000&env[LITESTREAM_ACCESS_KEY_ID]=REPLACE_ME&env[LITESTREAM_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY]=REPLACE_ME&env[LITESTREAM_BUCKET]=REPLACE_ME&env[LITESTREAM_PATH]=uptime-kuma&env[LITESTREAM_URL]=REPLACE_ME&env[LITESTREAM_REGION]=REPLACE_ME&ports=8000)

Clicking on this button brings you to the Koyeb App creation page with most of the settings pre-configured to launch this application.  You will need to replace the values for the following variables:

* `LITESTREAM_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: Set to the `keyID` for the Backblaze API key you created.
* `LITESTREAM_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: Set this to the `applicationKey` for the Backblaze API key you created.
* `LITESTREAM_BUCKET`: Set to the bucket name you created on Backblaze.
* `LITESTREAM_PATH`: Set to the directory name you want to use to store your Uptime Kuma database information.  All objects created by Litestream will be placed within this directory within the bucket.
* `LITESTREAM_URL`: Prepend `https://` to your Backblaze endpoint.  For example, if your endpoint is `s3.eu-central-003.backblazeb2.com`, enter `https://s3.eu-central-003.backblazeb2.com` for this field.
* `LITESTREAM_REGION`: Set this to the second component of your Backblaze endpoint.  For example, if your endpoint is `s3.eu-central-003.backblazeb2.com`, the region for this field would be `eu-central-003`.

_To modify this application example, you will need to fork this repository. Checkout the [fork and deploy](#fork-and-deploy-to-koyeb) instructions._

### Fork and deploy to Koyeb
